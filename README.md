Programs written with pseduocode first to determine any logical bugs or issues are paramount to creating mantainable, readable, and modular code. 
Further more using good polymorphic programming practices allow for creating generalized methods that can be used over and over again. 

As a computer scientist, gathering and understanding requirements from the client or requestor is the biggest challenge and first step toward solving a problem. 
My approach has not differed since initially learning Java and respecting the methods that set or mutate data. 

Computer scientists engineer new solutions using proven data structures, connecting to libraries to develop workable, readable, and maintainable code that can be robust and handle multiple incorrect input types as well as sanitizing data.
